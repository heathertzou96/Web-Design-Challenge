# Weather Visualization Project

## Background
Creating a visualization dashboard for showcasing the analysis on the weather of 500+ cities (refer to python-api-challenge repository).

### Task
Create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The dashboard will have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website has 7 pages in total: a landing page, 4 visualization pages, a "comparisons" page, and a "data" page. Additionally, on top of every page, the website will have a navigation menu that allows easy access to any of the 7 pages. At the very end, the website will be deployed on GitHub pages.
